# MikroTik RouterOS: Script Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts related to deploying and maintaining RouterOS platforms. It uses best practices of network engineers, system integrators as well as members of the community reachable through the [MikroTik Forum](http://forum.mikrotik.com).

# Motivation

Most scripts are the result of our work at [Foundation University](http://foundationu.com) in [Dumaguete City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumaguete). On top of its MPLS backbone the university operates two data centers and a regional ISP. The MPLS backbone was implemented back in 2014 and as of March 2016 the following routerboard models are used in production:

 * [CCR1036-8G-2S+EM](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-8G-2SplusEM)
 * [CCR1036-12G-4S](http://routerboard.com/CCR1036-12G-4S)
 * [CRS226-24G-2S+RM](http://routerboard.com/CRS226-24G-2SplusRM)
 * [RB2011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB2011UiAS-RM)
 * [RB3011UiAS-RM](http://routerboard.com/RB3011UiAS-RM)
 * [RB951Ui-2HnD](http://routerboard.com/RB951Ui-2HnD)
 * [RB951G-2HnD](http://routerboard.com/RB951G-2HnD)

This presentation took place in December 2014 in Manila as part of the first [MikroTik User Meeting in the Philippines](http://mum.mikrotik.com/2014/PH/info).
